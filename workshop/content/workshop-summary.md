You have completed the overview of the Tanzu Build Service!  In it, you discovered how the Tanzu Build service uses the open-source Cloud Native Buildpacks project to turn application source code into container images in a repeatable, secure, and scalable way. In addition to initial creation, you discovered how the Tanzu Build Service keeps images up-to-date to help alleviate the day 2 operational strain of application, operating system, and best practice updates.

Thank you for completing the workshop!  If you are interested in more information, please visit the [Tanzu Build Service page](https://tanzu.vmware.com/build-service).
