We're going to start our story with Cody. He's an absolute star in writing business applications using popular languages and frameworks, but he's not a deep expert on container infrastructure.

Cody has recieved requirements for, and written, a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) named "Spring Pet Clinic."  He is using Github as his source control, and since the application has passed testing, a 1.0.0 version has been created and is ready for deployment to Kubernetes.  

Feel free to take a look at the application on GitHub, but no specific action is needed.
